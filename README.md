**Crowdsource Complaint System (UMSafe)**
Final Year Project (FYP)

The Crowdsource Complaint System (CCS), also known as UMSafe, is a web-based and mobile-based complaint management system designed for Universiti Malaya.
The system enables students to report campus-related issues in real time, while providing administrators with powerful tools to manage complaints, monitor officer performance, and support data-driven decision-making.

This project aligns with:

SDG 16 – Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions

SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities
